# Domicile — full personal app prototype

**Prototype · planning only · not production**

Founder click-through of the **entire Domicile personal app** (kit ed. 3.2): Today · Map · Places · Explore · You, plus complete **Stays** guest & host paths, Ledger, move planning, arrivals, communities, and Explore mini-flows.

Phone frame (~390×844) on desktop with ambient glow; full-bleed on real phones. Warm parchment / terracotta / olive system. Zero build step, no CDN, system fonts.

## Open

```bash
open /workspace/domicile-full-prototype/index.html
# or
python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory /workspace/domicile-full-prototype
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765/`. Hash routes work (e.g. `#stays-search`, `#host-dashboard`, `#ledger`, `#move-planning`, `#move-checklist`, `#connected-services`). Bottom nav remembers the last screen per tab.

**Files:** `index.html` · `app.css` · `app.js` · this README.

## Suggested demo paths

### 60-second founder path (email-friendly)
1. **Today** — tap package arrival, then back; glance stay + turnover cards  
2. **Explore → Stays** → Search → **Oak & Waller Loft** → Instant book → Trips → **Demo: simulate unlock**  
3. **Places** → East Cesar Chavez Cottage → **Hosting** → Calendar (spot conflict)  
4. **You → Ledger** — source-attributed spend  

### Guest full spine
Explore → Stays → search → listing → checkout → Trips → unlock → check in → checkout → receipt

### Host spine
Places → Cottage → Hosting → Listing · Calendar · Reservation · Invite

### Home / community / move
Places → Home → Community (HOA) · **Today or You → Move Planning** → checklist → AI draft (HOA) → confirm send · USPS handoff · You → Permissions

### Connected services (~30s)
**You → Connected services** → Amazon (API apply · Follow home · Applied OK) → pin South Lamar / follow home → **Update now** → Exclude/Include on Move Planning → back → Move card shows follow/pinned/excluded counts. Add sheet lists capability honesty (API / Deep link / Draft). Demo only — not real OAuth.

### Move Planning (AI-assisted sketch)
Overview (East Cesar Chavez → South Lamar) → recipient checklist with channel/status chips → Assist draft preview (facts from Move Engine; you send) → USPS official-form handoff (never auto-filed) → Suggest missing recipients (DMV, voter reg demo tips)

## Product constraints honored
- Bottom nav fixed: Today · Map · Places · Explore · You  
- Private-cohort chrome + gated public discovery  
- Exact address / door codes only after unlock for confirmed guests  
- Guest ≠ household / tenant / resident  
- Sponsored clearly **Ad**-labeled before interaction  
- Fictional Austin sample data only (Oak & Waller Loft, East Cesar Chavez Cottage, etc.)  
- CSS gradient photo placeholders — no external image URLs  

## Technical notes
- Pure static; open via `file://` or any static host  
- Hash routing; nav memory per tab  
- No login wall  
- ~113 KB uncompressed (html+css+js); ~23 KB gzipped combined  

## Deliberate omissions
- No real payments, auth, MapLibre tiles, or provider APIs  
- Secondary listings / ads deep-link the primary demo spine  
- Earnings / exports / partner handoffs are toast stubs
